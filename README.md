# Hack-the-Trail-Project
Partnered with Walmart Technology as part of the Hack the Trail Hackathon Novemeber 2019

## About the Hack 

In the heart of Austin is the Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail at Lady Bird Lake, a 10-mile path that attracts more than 4.4 million visits a year for outdoor recreation. TTF is a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting and enhancing the Trail and ensuring it remains one of Austin’s premier places to visit. Outdoor Voices is an activewear brand on a mission to get the world moving and building happy, healthy lives. This enviro hack is an opportunity for Walmart Technology, TTF, Outdoor Voices, and the Austin community to come together to innovate and benefit the Trail. Throughout the weekend, attendees will form teams and participate in a series of challenges. Mentors will be onsite to help guide everyone through the process. The event is open to all technologists regardless of experience level. It is a great place to show off your skills! More than $10,000 will be awarded to the top three teams!


## Problem Statement

The Austin Parks department and TTF do not have a solid method for compiling, analyzing, and reviewing traffic data to make needed improvements surrounding the Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail at Lady Bird Lake.


## Data Science/Analytics Project (Project #1) – Forecasting Trail Traffic

The Austin Parks department has time series data on foot and bike traffic on a trail near downtown Austin. This data is influenced by a number of conditions, including weather, time of year, day of week, major and minor events, openings of new business and event spaces, and other more difficult-to-predict events and trends. Using historical data, participants will attempt to develop models that capture these sources of variability in the data and forecast future expected traffic on various locations within the trails. This should include models, statistics, visualizations, and, potentially, interfacing components to allow models to be retrained and/or queried.
